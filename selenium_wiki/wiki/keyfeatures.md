# Key Features of Selenium Automation Framework

- Code reusability
- Maximum coverage
- Recovery Scenario
- Low-cost maintenance
- Minimal manual intervention
- Easy reporting

# Types of Test Automation Framework

- Module Based Testing
- concept of abstraction
- divide the tests into independent module
- Library Architecture Testing
- identify and group the common tasks down inside the scripts into functions that then called by the main test scripts or the driver to create test cases.
- Data Driven Tesing
- data stored in table or spreadsheet allowing us to maintain a single test script that tests all the data in the table.
- Keyword-driven Testing
- segregate test data from test scripts they are connected by keywords.
- Hybrid Testing
- combo of many test automation framework
- Behaviour Driven Development
- easily understandable test. ie. cucumber, behave

# Steps invovled in Implementing Test Automation Processes

- Determine the scope and test planning
- Get application environment
- Analyze Application Under Test (AUT)
- Select test cases for Automation

- Generating basic tests
- Selenium IDE
- Using record facility
- Input test steps using element locators and selenese commands
- Selenim WebDriver
- using element locators
- using WebDriver methods

- Enhancing tests
- Selenium IDE
- using assert/selenese commands
- Selenium WebDriver
- using java conditional statements
- using TestNG assertion methods

- Running and Debugging tests

- Analyzing tests resuslts and reporting defects
